        competed in Formula One, and Sophie Kumpen. He had a successful run in

        At the 2015 Australian Grand Prix, when he was aged 17 years, 166 days,
        he became the youngest driver to compete in Formula One. After spending
        the 2015 season with Scuderia Toro Rosso, Verstappen started his 2016
        campaign with the Italian team before being promoted to parent team Red
        Bull Racing after four races as a replacement for Daniil Kvyat. At the
        age of 18, he won the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix on his debut for Red Bull
        Racing, becoming the youngest-ever driver and the first Dutch driver to
        win a Formula One Grand Prix.<br /><br />

        After winning the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Verstappen became the first
        Dutch driver to win the Formula One World Championship, and the 34th
        Formula One World Drivers' Champion. He won his second consecutive
        Formula One championship the next season.<br /><br />

        As of the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix, Verstappen has achieved 38 victories
        and 23 pole positions. He scored the first hat-trick of his career at
        the 2021 French Grand Prix and his first grand slam at the 2021 Austrian
        Grand Prix. He scored his second grand slam at the 2022 Emilia Romagna
        Grand Prix. Verstappen is set to remain at Red Bull until at least the
